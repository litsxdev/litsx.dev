# useEmit

Emit a CustomEvent from the current host without reaching for this.dispatchEvent(...). Think of useEmit as the small authored bridge between component logic and public DOM events.

- Kind: `Hook`

## Reference

```ts
import { useEmit } from "@litsx/core";
```

```ts
useEmit<Events extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined = undefined>(): Events extends Record<string, unknown> ? LitsxTypedEmit<Events> : LitsxEmit
```

## Usage

Use useEmit when a component needs to publish a DOM event as part of its public API.

This is a good fit for input-like controls, disclosure widgets, and selection components.

## Behavior

- The returned function keeps a stable identity across renders.
- Events default to `{ bubbles: true, composed: true, cancelable: false }`.
- Passing options overrides those defaults without replacing the rest of the event init object.

## Mental Model

useEmit keeps event emission explicit in authored code while still lowering directly to the native CustomEvent model.

## Examples

```ts
const emit = useEmit();

emit("change", value);
emit("submit", value, { cancelable: true });
```

## Pitfalls

- useEmit publishes events; it does not make internal values reactive for parents by itself.

## Returns

Type: `Events extends Record<string, unknown> ? LitsxTypedEmit<Events> : LitsxEmit`
